        Idea of simplicity and upcycling. <br> Settled in the Lithuanian
        countryside I share the idea of simplicity, reconnecting with nature,
        slowing down and focusing on myself and surroundings. I follow a zero
        waste lifestyle to live in harmony with nature, minimizing my
        footprint for future generations. I specialize in quality items that
        are simple, useful, recyclable or compostable, made to become a part
        of your home. The journey starts with the material - ceramic trinket,
        empty jar, yarn from the thrift shop, excess textiles - it whispers an
        idea and is transformed into natural soy candles, crochet storage
        baskets, decorative bowls - a one of a kind accessory. Processing time
        can stretch up to 3-4 days, as I do not travel to town daily. Please,
        re-use mailing bags, recycle or compost cardboard packaging. I do not
        send paper invoices, they are available upon request and I am more
        than happy to email them! <br> Sending a little piece of our lives to Your
        home with every item.
